# Chained-Hash-Table
The Chained Hash Table was a project for a Data Structures course. The purpose of this project was to create a hash table using Java that is able to use a seperate linked list in a hash table of size 10, that corresponds to each individual bucket in the hash table in order for each individual key entered into the hash table to be retrievable. This program allows the user to interact with the chained hash table in a variety of ways including adding positive integer values to the hash table, which is then placed into it's respective bucket with an assigned key, remove values from the hash table, getting a value currently inside the hash table, clearing all values of the hash table and emptying it, and finally quitting the program.
